## This is the starting folder for starting the yolov4 training process. 

## Includes
- /darknet/ is a cloned darknet Git repository (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
- /obj/ is an empty folder that you will fill with files and compress
- /training/ is an empty folder where weights will be saved
- /obj.data is an object data file template
- /obj.names is an object name file template
- /process.py is the training processing file
- /yolov4-custom.cfg is custom config file copied from darknet repository

## Directions
1. Follow the directions in the 'labeling' directory in the TAUV-Tools repository to generate contents of the 'obj' folder. Compress this to 'obj.zip'. 
2. Make adjustments to 'yolov4-custom.cfg' indicated by # comments. Change lines max_batches, steps, classes (x3 at each [yolo] layer), filters (x3 at each [convolutional] layer).
3. Edit 'obj.names' template file. Each class name is on a new line in the same order as in the 'class_list.txt' file in 'obj.zip'.  
4. Edit 'obj.data' template file. Fill in the number of classes.
5. Ensure that the 'process.py' has the correct format (currently .jpg) matching training data. 
6. Follow the following commands in your local directory to set up the training.
